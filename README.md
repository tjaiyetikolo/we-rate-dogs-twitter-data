# We Rate Dogs Data Analysis
## by Tioluwani Jaiye-Tikolo


## Introduction

> The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets. This project also includes two other datasets for one downloading programmatically for the image predictions of dog breeds and the other extracted via the Twitter API containing over 2000+ tweets from the WeRateDogs
